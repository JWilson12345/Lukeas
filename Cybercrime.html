                <li><strong>Trends in Cybercrime Attacks
:</strong> Cybercrime has evolved significantly over the past decade, with attacks becoming more sophisticated and widespread. A study by Mahmood and Pasha (2023) identifies key trends in cybercrime, including the rise of targeted attacks, such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), which are often state-sponsored and aimed at stealing intellectual property or compromising national security. Additionally, cybercriminals have increasingly been leveraging cryptocurrencies to facilitate anonymous transactions in illegal activities like ransomware attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Recent Data on Cybercrime:</strong> Recent studies show an alarming rise in cybercrime incidents worldwide. According to the 2023 Cybersecurity Ventures report, cybercrime damages are expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025 (Cybersecurity Ventures, 2023). This trend highlights the need for robust cybersecurity measures and international cooperation to prevent the growing threats of cybercrime.</li>
                <li><strong> Emerging Threats in Cybercrime:</strong> As cybercrime continues to evolve, new types of attacks are emerging, such as AI-driven cyberattacks and IoT-based vulnerabilities. A study by Al-Shaer et al. (2023) discusses the use of artificial intelligence in cybercrime, where attackers use AI to automate phishing attacks and develop malware that can learn and adapt to avoid detection..</li>
